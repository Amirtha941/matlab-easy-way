## 🎯 About This Repository

Hey there 👋  
This repository is my **personal MATLAB learning diary** — a place where I document everything I learn from the book  
**“MATLAB: Easy Way of Learning”** 📗.

The book provides a *lot* of exercises, examples, and challenges.  
Each day, I’ll solve **at least one exercise** — sometimes more if the concepts are simple.  

This journey doesn’t have a fixed end date — I’ll keep learning until I can confidently write **MATLAB code from scratch**,  
understand algorithms deeply, and apply them to real-world problems. 🚀  

I believe in **“learning by doing”**, so this repo will grow gradually — one exercise, one concept, one line of code at a time.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

🟢 **MATLAB Codes** — All exercises and examples I practice  
🟣 **Daily Notes** — Explanations of what I learned that day  
🔵 **Resources** — Helpful links, mini cheatsheets, and references  
🟠 **Progress Table** — My documented learning progress

## 🗓️ Progress Tracker

| Day | Date | Topic / Chapter | Exercise / Question | Notes / Notebook | Status |
|:---:|:----:|:----------------|:--------------------|:-----------------|:--------|
| 01 | 10/11/2025 | Introduction to MATLAB | Basics: Workspace, Commands | [Day-01](./Day-01_Introduction/README.md) | ✅ Completed |
| 02 | 11/11/2025 | Vectors | Vector operations | [Day-02](./Day-02_Vectors/README.md) | ✅ Completed |
| 03 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

🟢 = Completed  
🟡 = In Progress  
🔴 = Yet to Start

## 📘 Folder Structure


Each folder contains:
- The **MATLAB code** files (`.m`)
- A small **README** with what I learned, examples, and thoughts

---

## 🧭 How I Learn

1. Read a small section from the book 📖  
2. Understand the concept with examples  
3. Solve at least **one exercise** (or more if time allows)  
4. Write a **short reflection** on what I learned  
5. Upload it here for tracking 💻  

---

## 🌈 Why I’m Doing This

I believe real growth comes from **consistent practice and reflection**.  
By documenting my journey here, I can:
- Track my growth over time 🕰️  
- Share knowledge with others learning MATLAB 🤝  
- Build a strong base for projects in **Signal Processing, Communication, and ML**  

---

## 💬 Future Goals

- Finish all exercises from the book  
- Create mini-projects using what I learned  
- Apply MATLAB to real-world ECE problems  
- Maybe create a “**MATLAB for Beginners**” open series later 😄
